### Review M5.2 Course Content 

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
Highly constrained (discuss)  
Very useful for searching data w expected runtime O(log n)   
Shortcomings: can get unbalanced, can produce worst case runtime O(n)

**Heap**  
Not useful for searching for data values  
Useful for finding max (max heap) or min (min heap)  
More constraints than BST: shape and order properties  
Can be stored in an array

**Python module `heapq`**
