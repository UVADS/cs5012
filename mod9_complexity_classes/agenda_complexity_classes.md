- **Convex Hull Problem and Graham's Scan**  
Convex hull is smallest polygon excapsulating a shape or set of points 
> Convex Hulls deck slide7

A few important elements when implementing Graham:
- build convex hull using stack of points. can use Python list for the stack.
- when determining if new point can enter the hull, we form two vectors and take their [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product)    

- **Computational Complexity Classes**  
Complexity Hierarchy is an organization of algorithms (problem - solution pairs) based on Efficiency (Time and Space) 
  - P vs NP
  - NP-Completeness: class of problems where no efficient solution algorithm has been found

> Complexity Class Hierarchy deck. slide 5  
NP-complete examples include:
- k-clique problem slide 25
- Traveling Salesman Problem

Some of these problems use Operations Research tools for a solutions that is "good enough"
